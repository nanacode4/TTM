# 4 Temporary Traffic Management DesignProcess

## 4.1 TTM Planning

Traffic Signs and Site Characteristics:

**W**arn     the road user of the forthcoming works

**I**nform   the road user of the characteristics (e.g., roadway narrows, traffic control ahead etc.)

**D**irect   the road user safely through the site by means of arrows, cones, etc.

**E**nd   clearly sign the end of the roadworks site

##  4.2 TTM Elements

### 4.2.2 VMS

Protection:  speed limit of >100km/hr see p52 image

### 4.2.3 Tapers

A taper is the required length for the reduction in width of a single lane or hard shoulder.锥形段是指单车道或硬路肩宽度缩减所需的长度。

shuttle working is required to facilitate works on a single carriageway road, a 45° degree taper shall be used on both approaches in conjunction with a suitable method of traffic control.
在单车道道路上需要进行穿梭作业以方便施工时，应在两个进出方向使用 45° 锥形坡道。

### 4.2.4 Safety Zones

The lateral safety zone is measured from the base of the traffic edge of the cone to the edge of the works area. 
横向安全区是从交通锥底部边缘到施工区域边缘的距离。
