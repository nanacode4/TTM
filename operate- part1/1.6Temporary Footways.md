For short works areas (where length of works is less than twice the carriageway width), it is generally preferable to keep pedestrians on the same side as the works rather than instructing them to use the other side.

对于较短的施工区域（施工长度小于车道宽度的两倍），通常最好让行人与施工区域保持在同一侧，而不是指示他们使用另一侧。

## Temporary Footways
**1.2m**  1m

Sign WK 080 Pedestrians Cross to Left / WK 081 Pedestrians Cross to Right should be used;

**TMO** Dedicated personnel may be required to assist in directing pedestrians

Include **ramps** where a kerb or other obstruction is crossed;


## 1.6.4 Additional Controls
### Table 1.6.4.1: Additional Control Options

| **Hazard** | **Risk** | **Control** | **Drawing** |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Vulnerable Road Users** | Pedestrian | Divert to other footway | 1(a) |
|  |  | Provide footway along works | 1(b) |
|  |  | Provide crossing point | 1(c) |
|  | Cyclist | Signage | 1(d) |
| **Restricted Geometry and Multiple Junctions** | Visibility of Signage | Ensure visibility of sign = Cumulative Distance + Sign Visibility | 2 |
| **Heavy Traffic** | Risk of traffic to workers | Consider vehicle barriers (not vehicle restraint barriers) instead of cones | 3 |
| **Vehicle Manoeuvres** | Visibility of signage | Ensure visibility of sign = Cumulative Distance + Sign Visibility | 4 |
| **Access to Premises** | Blocking pedestrian access | Provide ramp and/or pedestrian controller | 5 |
| **Public Transport Interaction** | Blocking stopping point – Access / Egress | Provide access / egress layout | 6 |
| **Surfacing works** |  | These are complex jobs and will generally require several phases of TTM plans (TTMPs). | 7(a) |
| **Other Considerations** | Night-time works | Use of floodlighting may be required (even in lit areas). Floodlights should be positioned away from vehicle hazard zones, give a consistent level of lighting (to minimum working standards) and avoid dazzling travelling public. | 7(b) |
|  | Unattended works | Site should be minimised, while still maintaining any necessary safety zones. Barriers should be used for any open excavations, including those on the carriageway. Unnecessary advance warning signs should be turned in to ensure they are not visible or alternatively replaced. | 7(c) |
